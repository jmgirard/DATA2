To explore the possibilities, go to **Tools** > **Global Options**. The most noticeable things you can change are aspects of RStudio's appearance. If you click on the *Appearance* section, you can select a different zoom level, editor font, font size, and editor theme. I usually teach with the default settings and you can keep everything the same if you want your computer to match the one I teach from, but for my own work I use the \"Tomorrow Night 80s\" theme and a custom font called [Fira Code](https://jmgirard.com/firacode/). I also make slight changes to the *Pane Layout* section that I'd be happy to describe to you in class if you're interested.\n\nAll of this stuff is optional, but a few changes that I'd recommend making are to go to the *General* section and make sure that \"Restore .RData into workspace at startup\" is unchecked and that \"Save workspace to .RData on exit\" is set to \"Never\". Finally, under the *Code* section and the Display tab, I like to check the box for \"Allow scroll past end of document\".\n\n## Question 2 (Console)\n\nRead what the user wanted to do and look at the command they sent to R. Fix the errors in the commands and calculate the answers.\n\na)  I want to add 20 and 0.2 and divide that sum by 4.1. But I get an error when I try:<br />`[20 + .2] \\ 4.1`\nb)  I want to multiply 6 by the sum of 2 and 1,300. But I get an error when I try:<br />`6 x (2 + 1,300)`\n\n<p><details>\n<summary>Click here for the answer key</summary>\n<blockquote>\n\n**Answer (a)**\n\nChange the brackets `[]` to parentheses `()` because parentheses `()` are the order-of-operations operator in R. Also, change the backslash `\\` to a forward slash `/` because forward slash `/` is the division operator in R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(20 + .2) / 4.1\n#> [1] 4.926829\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Answer (b)**\n\nChange the `x` to an asterisk `*` because asterisk `*` is the multiplication operator in R. Also, remove the comma `,` from `1,300` because R doesn't use commas to delimit digits in large numbers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n6 * (2 + 1300)\n#> [1] 7812\n```\n:::\n\n\n</blockquote></details></p>\n\n## Question 3 (Scripts)\n\nCreate a new R script file and copy your answers to Question 2 into it. Add some comments to explain which line of code corresponds to 2a and 2b. I'll talk about this more in [06a], but it is a good idea to get into the practice of keeping your code organized and commented. Organized code will also make grading easier, and a happy grader is associated with a happy student. ðŸ˜‰\n\n<p><details>\n<summary>Click here for the answer key</summary>\n<blockquote>\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## File > New File > R Script (or equivalent shortcuts)\n\n# Question 2a\n(20 + .2) / 4.1\n\n# Question 2b\n6 * (2 + 1300)\n\n## File > Save (or equivalent shortcuts)\n```\n:::\n\n</blockquote></details></p>\n\n## Fun Stuff\n\n### The Literal Genie\n\nWhat it feels like to talk to R sometimes...\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/58l7ZqoU0a0 >}}\n\n",
