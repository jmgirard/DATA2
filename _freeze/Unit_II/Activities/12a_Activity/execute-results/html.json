Facet the plot such that there are seven columns showing `class` levels and three rows showing `drv` levels.\n\n<p><details>\n<summary>Click here for the answer key</summary>\n<blockquote>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  facet_grid(drv~class)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12a_Activity_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n</blockquote></details></p>\n\n## Question 2\n\nCreate a stacked bar chart from `mpg` that shows the proportion of each `class` of car that uses each type of drive train (`drv`). Use this plot to answer: which class of car uses only front-wheel drive (i.e., `\"f\"`) and which class of car is the most balanced in terms of using different types of drive trains? *Hint:* All bars should be the same height.\n\n<p><details>\n<summary>Click here for the answer key</summary>\n<blockquote>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = class, fill = drv)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12a_Activity_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAll **minivans** in this dataset use the front-wheel drive type of drive train, and the **subcompact** class is the most balanced.\n</blockquote></details></p>\n\n## Question 3\n\nCreate a ggplot from `mpg` that maps `hwy` to x and `manufacturer` to y; use `stat_summary()` to plot a pointrange geom for each manufacturer that puts the point at the median value and extends the range to the minimum and maximum values. Use this plot to answer: which two manufacturers exceeded 25 mpg highway fuel efficiency for all their cars in this dataset?\n\n<p><details>\n<summary>Click here for the answer key</summary>\n<blockquote>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = hwy, y = manufacturer)) +\n  stat_summary(\n    fun = median,\n    fun.min = min,\n    fun.max = max,\n    geom = \"pointrange\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12a_Activity_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Hidden shortcut function :)\nmpg |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = hwy, y = manufacturer)) +\n  stat_summary(\n    fun.data = median_hilow,\n    geom = \"pointrange\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Computation failed in `stat_summary()`\nCaused by error in `fun.data()`:\n!
