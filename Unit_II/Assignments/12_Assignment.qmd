## Instructions

*Create a new Quarto document (HTML format), clear out the boilerplate code/text, and use this document to store your answers to each of the six questions below. Be sure to enable `embed-resources` using the header below. If your answer involves writing text, then use markdown to write 2--4 sentences per question; if you answer involves running code, then use one or more code chunks. For questions that ask you to fix code, correct any errors (while achieving the stated goal) and include only the working code in your document.*

```markdown
---
format: 
  html:
    embed-resources: true
---
```

*Please clearly mark which part of your document is answering which question (e.g., using markdown headings) and remove any "scratch work" or failed attempts from your document before submitting it. Finally, note that many essay-style questions will require you to read between the lines and use your imagination (as opposed to just looking up the answer in the lecture).*


## Question 1

Recreate the figure below from the `txhousing` dataset (included in \{tidyverse\}). *Hint:* You will need to filter the dataset to only include those three cities shown below.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
txhousing |> 
  filter(city %in% c("Dallas", "Irving", "Waco")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = sales)) + 
  facet_wrap(~city, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") + 
  geom_line()
```


## Question 2

a) Filter the `starwars` dataset to only include characters from the "Droid", "Human", and "Twi'lek" species.

b) Plot this filtered dataset using a dodged bar chart that counts the number of characters from each `species` in each `gender`. Which of these three species was the most balanced in terms of gender?


## Question 3

I am interested in the amount of poverty in the midwestern US states. Relevant data is stored in the `midwest` dataset (comes in the \{tidyverse\} package). Use the `stat_summary()` function to plot the mean and 95\% confidence interval of the `percbelowpoverty` variable in each `state` using a "pointrange" geom.


<p><details><summary>Hint</summary><blockquote>
Your plot should look something like this:
```{r}
#| echo: false

midwest |> 
  ggplot(aes(y = state, x = percbelowpoverty)) + 
  stat_summary(
    fun.data = mean_cl_normal,
    geom = "pointrange"
  )
```
</blockquote></details></p>



## Question 4

Compare these three representations of the same data. Describe, in text, how was each made (e.g., what functions were used). What are the pros and cons of each and which is your favorite?

```{r}
#| echo: false

set.seed(2020)
df <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(120, c(0, 2, 4)),
  y = rnorm(120, c(1, 2, 1)),
  group = letters[1:3]
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig:height: 4

ggplot(df, aes(x, y, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Plot 1") +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.width: 7
#| fig:height: 3

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~group, labeller = label_both) + 
  labs(title = "Plot 2") +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| fig.width: 7
#| fig:height: 3

library(gghighlight)
ggplot(df, aes(x, y, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~group, labeller = label_both) + 
  gghighlight() + 
  labs(title = "Plot 3") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Question 5

Imagine that you have ggplot objects called `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E`. Provide the \{patchwork\} command you could use to create the layout shown below. Optionally, create five different plots (even if they only differ slightly) and test this out.

<p><details><summary>Hint</summary><blockquote>
This is probably easier to achieve with `+`, `|`, and `/` than with `plot_layout()`.
</blockquote></details></p>


## Question 6

Your friend just got a paper accepted in a journal that has a lot of rules about what figures can look like. They already has two ggplot objects called `first_fig` and `second_fig` that contain her two figures. Explain to them how to export these objects to files that meets all the publisher's rules. For maximal clarity, provide code they can use.

**Rule 1:** All axis titles must be in italics.

**Rule 2:** All figures must be exactly 88 mm wide and no taller than 234 mm.

**Rule 3:** All figures must be separate files named `fig_X` (where `X` is a whole number representing the order in which the figure appears in the paper such as `fig_1` or `fig_2`).

**Rule 4:** All figures must be saved in a vector format.

<p><details><summary>Hint</summary><blockquote>
For Rule 1, use themes (discussed in Unit I). For the other rules, use your best judgment, as they may have several acceptable solutions.
</blockquote></details></p>

âœ… Done! *Please save and then render your document to an HTML file. Check it over to make sure it is complete (and rendered properly) and then upload this file to Canvas by the deadline listed on the syllabus. Note that, if any of your code chunks has an error in it, the HTML file will not render properly (this is why removing scratch work is important).*
