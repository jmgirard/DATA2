#### Unit Projects (1/unit, 2 total)
- Apply your new skills to real-world data you care about
- Challenge yourself to learn new things and specialize


## Course Materials {.smaller}

No required textbooks or readings. However, this course was heavily inspired by the following book, which you can access for free online (or pay to order a physical copy):

- [R for Data Science (1st Edition)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Wickham & Grolemund

The following texts are where I would recommend you turn after completing this course (or during it, if you are feeling ambitious) to dive into more advanced topics about visualization and programming, respectively.

- [ggplot2: Elegent graphics for data analysis (3rd Edition)](https://ggplot2-book.org/) by Wickham

- [Advanced R (2nd Edition)](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Wickham


## Grading Policies {.smaller}
