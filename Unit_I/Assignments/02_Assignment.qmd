## Instructions

*Open the Project you created to store your course files in RStudio (if it is already open, skip this part; if you didn't create a Project already, do so now). Then create a new Quarto document (HTML format), clear out the boilerplate code/text, and use this document to store your answers to each of the six questions below. If your answer involves writing text, then use markdown to write 2--4 sentences per question; if you answer involves running code, then use one or more code chunks. Please clearly mark which part of your document is answering which question (e.g., using markdown headers). Please remove any "scratch work" or failed attempts from your document before submitting it. Finally, note that many essay-style questions will require you to read between the lines and use your imagination (as opposed to just looking up the answer in the lecture).*


## Question 1 (R and RStudio)

a) Why are we using R in this course and not some other programming language?

b) What are R and RStudio? How are they related and how are they different? Please explain in your own words (i.e., don't just repeat my car example from lecture).


## Question 2 (Console)

a) Use R as a calculator to answer the following question: what is negative one plus two-thirds?

b) Use R as a calculator to answer the following question: what is the product of 1.234 and five-raised-to-the-sixth-power?


## Question 3 (Scripts)

a) What are the differences between running code in the console, in a script, and in a Quarto document? When might an R user want to use each of these approaches?

b) What are code comments and when might they be useful? How are code comments in a script different from markdown in a Quarto document?


## Question 4 (Projects)

a) What is the purpose of a Project in RStudio? Why do I recommend creating a project rather than simply saving all your course stuff in a normal computer folder?

b) What are some benefits of having a consistent naming convention for the files in your project? What kinds of tasks might be easier if you stick with a convention?


## Question 5 (Quarto)

a) What is the difference between a .qmd file and a .html file created by Quarto? When would you send the .qmd file to a collaborator and when would you send the .html file?

b) Quarto lets you include many code chunks in the same document. When would you want to put all your code in a single chunk and when would you want to break it up across multiple chunks?


## Question 6 (Markdown)

a) Use markdown headings to break your document into sections: one per question. Because Header level 1 is usually used for a document title, I recommend using Header level 2. (Please continue using markdown headings in your future assignments.)

b) The verbatim code format in markdown is really useful when we want to talk about code in text without actually running that code. For instance, I can say that division in R is accomplished using the `/` symbol as in `1 / 2`. Practice using verbatim code by re-writing your code from Question 2a in text here.

âœ… Done! *Please save and then render your document to an HTML file. Check it over to make sure it is complete (and rendered properly) and then upload this file to Canvas by the deadline listed on the syllabus. Note that, if any of your code chunks has an error in it, the HTML file will not render properly (this is why removing scratch work is important).*
