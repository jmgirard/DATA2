## Question 1

The following table summarizes the season information for the eight seasons of AMC's *Breaking Bad* show. 

a) Tidy up this data and save it to a tibble. Decide for yourself how to handle season 5 (should it be a single observation or two?). For the first and last aired dates, just store the year as a number.

b) Save the tibble you created to a CSV file named "breaking_bad.csv".

**Part (a)**

Version with one observation for the season five parts

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
season <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
episodes <- c(7, 13, 13, 13, 16)
first_air <- c(2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012)
last_air <- c(2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013)
network <- "AMC"
breaking_bad <- 
  tibble(season, episodes, first_air, last_air, network)
breaking_bad
```

Version with two separate observations for the season five parts

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
season <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5.1, 5.2)
episodes <- c(7, 13, 13, 13, 8, 8)
first_air <- c(2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013)
last_air <- c(2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013)
network <- "AMC"
breaking_bad <- 
  tibble(season, episodes, first_air, last_air, network)
breaking_bad
```

**Part (b)**

```{r}
#| message: false
#| eval: false

write_csv(breaking_bad, "breaking_bad.csv")
```

## Question 2

Load the `starwars` dataset, which is included in \{tidyverse\}. This means that, as long as the package is loaded in your session/document, you can just type its name (`starwars`) and R will be able to access it as if you had imported it.

a) Use an R command to calculate how many variables and observations are in this tibble.

b) Use an R command to extract the `height` vector from this tibble.

<blockquote>

**Part (a)**
```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
dim(starwars)
```

There are 87 rows and 14 columns.

**Part (b)**
```{r}
starwars$height
```

</blockquote></details></p>

## Question 3

a) Download the `kaggle_cereal.csv` file from Canvas and save it to your class Project folder.

b) Use \{tidyverse\} to import this file into R as a tibble named `cereal`, using an argument to make the missing values (coded as `"missing"`) into `NA`s.

**Part (b)**

cereal <- read_csv("../../data/kaggle_cereal.csv", na = "missing")
cereal
